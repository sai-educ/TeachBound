## Architecture

### Component Hierarchy
The application follows a top-down data flow pattern with centralized state management in App.js:

1. **App.js** - Root component managing global state including:
   - Tool selection and configuration (pen, eraser, shapes, etc.)
   - History management for undo/redo functionality
   - Element lifecycle (creation, editing, deletion)
   - Coordinates sticky note and text editing states

2. **Canvas.js** - Core drawing surface implementing:
   - High-resolution canvas setup with device pixel ratio handling
   - Drawing logic for pen strokes, shapes, and elements
   - Selection and manipulation of elements
   - Export functionality (PNG with 1x/2x/3x scaling, PDF generation)
   - Real-time dragging and positioning updates

3. **Toolbar.js** - Tool selection and configuration panel providing:
   - Main tools (select, pen, eraser, sticky notes, text)
   - Shape tools dropdown (rectangle, circle, triangle, line, arrow)
   - Color pickers for stroke and fill
   - Line width and font size selectors
   - Action buttons (undo, redo, delete, clear)
   - Export options dropdown

### State Management Pattern
The application uses a custom history-based state management for undo/redo:
- Elements are stored in a history array at `history[historyStep]`
- Each user action creates a new history entry
- Navigation through history is done via `historyStep` index
- The `updateElementsAndHistory` function ensures immutable updates

### Canvas Rendering Strategy
- Uses 2D canvas context with high DPI support
- Elements are redrawn on each update rather than using retained mode
- Implements double buffering for smooth interactions
- Separate rendering contexts for screen display vs. export

## Key Implementation Details

### High-Resolution Canvas
The canvas implements device pixel ratio scaling to ensure crisp rendering on high-DPI displays. The `setupHighResCanvas` function in Canvas.js handles this by:
- Scaling the canvas buffer by devicePixelRatio
- Maintaining CSS size for proper display
- Applying the scale transform to the drawing context

### Element Types
Each drawable element has a consistent structure:
- `id`: Unique identifier (timestamp-based)
- `type`: pen, sticky, text, rectangle, circle, triangle, line, arrow
- `x`, `y`: Position coordinates
- Additional type-specific properties (paths, text content, dimensions, colors)

### Export Functionality
- **PNG Export**: Creates offscreen canvas at specified scale (1x, 2x, 3x)
- **PDF Export**: Generates print-friendly HTML with embedded image data

### Sticky Note and Text Editing
Uses a floating textarea positioned absolutely over the canvas element during editing. The editing flow:
1. Element creation triggers edit mode
2. Textarea positioned at element coordinates
3. Blur or Enter key commits the text
4. Escape key cancels editing

## Testing Approach

The project uses React Testing Library with Jest. When writing tests:
- Focus on user interactions rather than implementation details
- Test the complete user flow (tool selection ‚Üí drawing ‚Üí export)
- Mock canvas context methods as needed
- Verify state changes through rendered output

## Deployment

The application is deployed on Vercel and configured as a single-page React app. The production build optimizes bundle size and enables service worker for offline capability.

## Important Conventions

### Color Accessibility
The application uses a curated set of accessible colors defined in Toolbar.js:
- High contrast colors for drawing tools
- Distinct sticky note colors for visual organization
- Transparent fill option for shapes

### Responsive Design
- Toolbar adapts display mode (icons only, text only, or both)
- Canvas fills available space while maintaining aspect ratio
- Mobile touch events are supported alongside mouse events

### Performance Considerations
- Debounced canvas redrawing during drag operations
- Efficient element selection using bounding box calculations
- Lazy loading of export functionality

## Current Features (Phase 1 - Implemented)

### Auto-Save & Recovery
- Work automatically saves to localStorage every 5 seconds and on changes
- Recovers canvas state on page reload
- Manual save with Cmd/Ctrl+S
- Save indicator shows confirmation

### Copy/Paste/Duplicate
- Copy selected elements (Cmd/Ctrl+C)
- Paste elements (Cmd/Ctrl+V) with 20px offset
- Duplicate selected elements (Cmd/Ctrl+D)
- Clipboard state persists during session

### Keyboard Shortcuts
**Tool Selection:**
- `V` - Selection tool
- `P` - Pen tool
- `H` - Highlighter tool
- `E` - Eraser tool
- `N` - Sticky note
- `T` - Text tool
- `R` - Rectangle
- `C` - Circle
- `L` - Line
- `A` - Arrow

**Actions:**
- `Cmd/Ctrl+Z` - Undo
- `Cmd/Ctrl+Shift+Z` or `Cmd/Ctrl+Y` - Redo
- `Cmd/Ctrl+A` - Select all
- `Delete/Backspace` - Delete selected
- `Escape` - Clear selection

### Highlighter Tool
- Semi-transparent drawing (30% opacity)
- 3x line width for highlighting effect
- Uses multiply blend mode for realistic highlighting
- Preserves color selection

## Common Development Tasks

### Adding a New Drawing Tool
1. Add tool definition in Toolbar.js `mainTools` or `shapeTools` array with shortcut
2. Implement drawing logic in Canvas.js `handleMouseDown/Move/Up`
3. Add tool-specific options in Toolbar if needed
4. Update element rendering in `redrawAllElements`
5. Add keyboard shortcut in App.js `handleKeyDown`

### Modifying Export Formats
Export logic is contained in Canvas.js `downloadAsPNG` and `downloadAsPDF` methods. These create offscreen canvases and redraw all elements at the target resolution.

### Updating Styling
- Global styles in index.css
- Component-specific styles in [Component].css files
- Uses CSS variables for theme consistency
- Open Sans font family throughout
